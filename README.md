##FOREWORD

We are in an era of dramatic changes.

The technology giant has monopolized the digital life of us.

Google, owing a search engine, accounts for 90% of the global market share; Facebook has more than 1 billion active users per day. For each $1 e-commerce transaction generated in the United States, 44 cents came from Amazon.

In today's Internet world, the centralized Internet giants control the amounts of user data and traffic around the world, and enjoy the profits they bring. In front of the giants, the property rights and privacy of individuals have been seriously violated. Users have gradually become a cash machine and other innovators in traditional fields are suppressed in the unfair competition. For example, Facebook has revealed personal data of more than 87 million users, and application developers need to pay one-third of the software revenue to Apple's App Store.

In this case, some de-centralized new forces are emerging.

In 2009, with Nakamoto creating the first Bitcoin block, distributed ledgers began to attract people's attention. In 2015, Ethereum with its smart contract technology enabled the blockchain technology to enter the 2.0 era. With the rapid development of technology, TON that supports closely matching and infinite slice technology become the hallmark of the third generation of blockchain.

The birth of blockchain technology ensures that information cannot be falsified, and enhances user privacy and security. More importantly, this is a mechanism in which everyone can participate and avoid a strong central power.

Today, the United States, China, and Russia regard blockchain technology as a part of the national strategy. Blockchain technology application has been applied to almost all industries. 

However, decentralized technology and centralized technology inevitably have conflicts. According to Chris Dixon (2016), the first phase of the Internet (from the 1980s to the 2005s), open-ended agreements established the foundation of the Internet. The second phase of the Internet (from 2005 to the present), the four Internet giants were born. Today, it is likely to enter the third phase of the Internet, during which blockchain technology is providing unprecedented possibilities for the rich Internet ecosystem.

There is no doubt that we are in an era of turbulence and a turning point.

In this competition, the decentralized technology undoubtedly provides a stronger community vitality, a more attractive value proposition and greater potentiality. That is why I want to create this platform.

In the Taobao on Chains, the material world is linked with the digital world. In a digital parallel world, the reality information will be uploaded to the chain, and each person will interact and trade with equal rights. Equality, openness, transparency and security are the natural attributes of this platform.

It is firmly believed that the huge barriers to centralization will eventually be broken; 
It is firmly believed that the digital world is the inevitable trend of history; 
It is firmly believed that the new era is an open era, in which everyone can participate, generate and share profits together. 

## 1. What is Taobao on Chains?

As a platform and bridge connecting the material world and the digital world, Taobao on Chains (TOC)’s goal is to solve the problem of digital asset identification and trading difficulties in the current digital age. However, the blockchain technology that has been highly anticipated by people has encountered problems such as “asset-winding” and “cross-chain circulation. It is difficult to bridge the gap between virtual and reality. The huge potential is suppressed. This program is aimed to create a new type of "a protocol layer - technology layer - application layer" blockchain platform supporting digital asset identification, circulation, and trading.

•	**In the agreement layer**, TOC will propose a consensus agreement system for asset identification and circulation of “hash mode” structure based on the full investigation of national laws and regulations, social culture and trade habits. 
•	**In the technical layer**, TOC, through the " TOC Node" [*] technology system to solve the problem of asset chaining and cross-chain circulation.
•	**In the application layer**, application platform and APIs are provided to offer hundreds of millions of users with simple, reliable and secure application products to complete the identification and trading of various assets. 

> *. Participants (organizations or individuals) who contribute to TOC are referred to "TOC nodes", which are divided into two categories. The first one is the implementer of functions, such as the operation and maintenance node of the asset cross-chain and the authentication nods, which accepts the technical output of the hash and follows the relevant protocol; the second is the builders, such as the standard setters of digital feature extraction and the supervisors of the operation of the TOC system, promoting this system to adapt to new demands and ensuring the safety and fairness of the entire system.

## 2.	Why does the digital age require TOC? 
### 2.1 Pain Points of Asset Confirmation and Circulation in the Digital Age
The current entity assets confirmation, such as company registration, property transfer, is confirmed through paper contracts, and the entire process is extremely complicated and cumbersome. Besides, the transaction calls for repeated communication and negotiation by both sides to achieve a consensus. Additionally, the validity of signatures is greatly influenced by subjective judgments. With the development of digital technology, the possibilities of individual signatures being copied and stolen are becoming higher and higher, resulting in numerous property disputes. At the same time, the large amount of non-intangible assets (algorithms, software, patents, copyrights, etc.) is more cumbersome to register and confirm the rights, and because its dd, there are not effective ways to solve this problem.

Different from the above two types of mainstream assets, when people enter the digital age, the "big data" assets, known as the "new era uranium mine", obtained in the interaction process between the user and the platform, due to the lack of means of rights confirming, are ignored or even intentionally encroached and plundered by the platform. User's creativity, attention, relationship, privacy, etc. have become profitable tools for platform giants, and there are not available methods securing individual rights and privacy.



In the field of asset circulation, asset registration and exchange are currently provided by service organizations or industry organizations. However, cumbersome and inefficient processes, outdated equipment and backward systems lead to that assets with low liquidity face security risks in the process of asset registration and exchange. Counterfeiting, breach of contract, information disclosure, data tampering and loss often occur. This centralized asset circulation model has many drawbacks. There is an urgent need for a new solution.

### 2.2 Industry opportunities brought by the application of blockchain technology

Trust is the foundation of asset exchange.Blockchain technology uses a new encryption authentication technology and a decentralized consensus mechanism to maintain a complete, distributed, non-tamperable account, so that participants do not need to know each other and establish a letter Under the premise of the relationship. The unified management of system ensures the security of asset management, exchange and related information.This is of great significance for asset registration and asset exchange.

#### 2.2.1 Asset Token Offering

**(1) Improve the transparency of asset information and prevent counterfeiting**

The current chaotic, inefficient management of asset management and the non-opacity of asset information have greatly increased the risk of asset management and exchange. The blockchain is supported by a large number of distributed nodes and computer servers on the peer-to-peer network. Each node holds a copy of the blockchain data. The behavior of a single node trying to modify the asset information on the chain can be effectively prevented. With the design of the blockchain incentive mechanism, it can increase the cost of fraudulent business and effectively curb counterfeiting. At present, in the traditional automobile and mobile phone market, the second-hand hand-made goods may be sold at the new product price. In the future, the real value of the goods can be clearly understood through the blockchain, and the merchants are prevented from shoddy.In 2015, the total size of the global copycat market has reached 1.70 billion US dollars, equivalent to about 2.5% of the global GDP.The table below shows the relevant data for the 2022 annual counterfeit and shoddy market predicted by Frontier Economics.

**(2) Meet the needs of asset supervision and auditing**

At present, the laws and regulations of the world in the blockchain industry have not yet formed a uniform one. This program is aimed to cooperate from legal lawyers in different countries at the beggining, and try its best to ensure that the assets and circulation of community assets comply with international laws and regulations and complete the registration of national regulatory agencies.

#### 2.2.2 Assets circulate in the chain
**(1) Reduce the risk of trust**

Blockchain technology has open source and transparent features. System participants know the running rules of the system and the authenticity and integrity of history, and can verify the contents of the ledger and the books, which improves the traceability of the system. The smart contract is the core of the asset circulation business. It has extremely high reliability and fault tolerance, which reduces the trust and risk of the system.Therefore, the trader does not have to worry about the problem of the seller's brushing, while the buyer is more clear about the products' production process.
It is easy to trade on the world, and it doesn't need to spend a lot of time on verifying the identity of sellers.

**(2) Improve the efficiency of asset management, exchange and settlement**

The blockchain uses distributed storage and accounting. All exchanged data is displayed in real time on a globally shared electronic sub-form platform. Real-time clearing makes the exchange data more transparent and the exchange efficiency is greatly improved. Effectiveness reduces the cost of asset exchange and systemic risk. Since all document files or asset information data can be embodied in the form of code or ledger book, smart contract. For example, a smart contract can write the terms of the option into the agreement, guaranteeing the auto-execution of the contract and default payment.

**(3) Reduce the cost of asset management**

The traditional asset registration and exchange often face problems such as long process, multiple links, and information asymmetry.The blockchain simplifies the exchange process, reduces the asset information exchange between different asset investment institutions, and saves a large amount of human power, material strength and time, which is of great significance for improving the liquidity of asset investment value.

### 2.3 How assets are tokenized and circulated

(1) **Fill in the initial information form for each type of asset before tokenization**, and the digital transformation of each asset type must be implemented separately, using a different process. 

For example, the car color, the mileage, the model, the year of production and the contact information of the car, and the IoT data loaded in the car will be uploaded to the blockchain network , reflectintg the state of the car's assets in real time. This information is stored in the blockchain. 

(2) **At the same time, multi-party verification is required to assess the final value of the assets.** Taking real estate as an example, since the historical data of real estate transaction is recorded in the blockchain, the Token can motivate users to disclose the property information spontaneously, reducing the information asymmetry between the buyers and sellers. After negotiation, they can use the smart contract to prevent fraudulent transactions, which prevent the seller’s possible loss caused by the arrears of the payment. The specific process is as follows:

**(3) The smart contract acquires the existing legal status of the asset**, and the degree of association between the asset-winding field and the securitized asset determines that this module's business is subject to policy. In some countries, the law requires that the transfer must take some form of action, and that the real assets are traded on the chain. It also requires the permission of the local party.

**(4) In addition, the core problem lies in the accuracy of the mapping of assets on the chain.** In order to ensure the completion of asset delivery and the authenticity of assets, institutions may be required to endorse. However, the protection of false data, forged assets and other issues need to collect information of various dimensions, such as pictures, to add credit to assets. Besides, it needs to adopt a reasonable coding format to guarantee the uniqueness of the asset. For example, a digital fingerprint is generated by a hash function to prevent counterfeiting of the asset.

**(5) Finally, ensuring a consistency issue between the assets on the chain and real-world is key.** In the real world, accidents such as stealling and houses being burned, etc. How to ensure the consistency of assets on the chain when real assets occur such accidents is a problem that needs to be solved.

## 3. TOC's vision and value proposition
**TOC's vision** for the future is to create a “digital era of Taobao” in the community —— in order to create an open and trust digital word ensuring the security of asset information and the convenience and efficiency of asset circulation.

**TOC's value proposition** is to implement the following core values:

1.	Utilize the blockchain technology to unicom virtual and reality and break through the gap between the chain and the reality, so that the individual assets can be authenticed and free to transfer.

2.	Pursue the truth, respect science and technology, and create a credible digital age. Form a community culture of academic rigor and self-freedom, credit and reputation.

3.	Adhere to the spirit of open source, collaboration and innovation. Adhering to the concept of community governance. Contribute to establishing a development model in which everyone participates and gain benefits, promoting social progress.

## 4. TOC's territory
The future of TOC is aimed at becoming the Taobao in the digital age. In the future, TOC will connect China Unicom's material world and digital world into a center of all kinds of original assets, digital assets and physical assets. It will make asset authentication more secure, and asset circulation on the chain will be more natural, easily, and efficiently. The following is a schematic diagram of the TOC future layout architecture. The protocol-technology-application provided by the three-in-one infrastructure, through the closed-loop interaction with the TOC community, this system can be constantly updated and improved.

### 4.1 Protocol layer
#### 4.1.1 Introduction
Just as the tcp/ip protocol of Internet transmission and communication solves the problem of how information flows freely in a multi-center, leading people to truly enter the era of Internet,  TOC consensus agreement solves the problem of how value is freely circulated in a multi-centered mind, leading people to open the door to connecting real and virtual worlds.

From the perspective of asset classification, all current assets can be divided into three categories: **“original blockchain assets”**, **“new data assets”** and **“traditional equity assets”**.

- **Origianl blockchain assets**

Among them, “original blockchain assets” are digital currency and digital assets represented by “Ethernet” and “Ethercat”, which are produced, used and transferred on the blockchain. This asset and the blockchain technology are highly coupled, confirmed by the account address and circulated in the form of smart contract. The use rights can be directly determined by the consensus mechanism of the blockchain and the smart contract set by the developer.

- **Big data assets**

Different from the “original blockchain assets”, the “big data assets” has digital characteristics, but it is hardly defined as the former one. Assets that are characterized by "bits" can be classified into this category, including texts, pictures, sounds, videos, etc. that are actively uploaded by the user, and also generated by interaction between the user and the platform. 

From the perspective of property rights confirmation, “original blockchain assets” are controlled by blockchain key accounts, with clear property rights, while “big data assets” are generated from humans and computers, Internet networks. In the interaction, property rights are not unclear, and thus are often abused and misappropriated by the centralized platform. 

From the point of view of asset transfer, due to the reproducibility of data, the traditional centralized escrow transaction easy mode and account period mode have failed, greatly reducing the initiative of people to develop and utilize data. In the future, the blockchain will be directly applied to the determination and transfer of “big data assets” to stimulate resource potential.

- **Traditional equity assets**

“Traditional equity assets”, including non-intangible assets such as real estate, automobile and other tangible assets as well as copyright trademarks, will also be transformed in new changes in the digital age.

On the one hand, with the golden financial and property rights structure not constantly innovating, “physical assets” have a digital form, including stocks, exchange vouchers, etc., increasing the liquidity, making concentricized trading become possible; on the other hand, as the form of physical assets becomes more divers, the fidelity traceability of blockchains will bring an increase in essential efficiency.

TOC consensus protocol defines the rules for the tokenization of various types of assets, as well as the standard of the flow of assets between the various chains, based on blockchain technology, through learning the structure of the "class" and the inheritance of the relationship chain, allowing for more assets to be tokenized with flexibility and completeness.

#### 4.1.2 Implement roadmap
这里是图片

The protocol layer is connected to virtual and reality, which is the first step and a key step in asset digitization. The ultimate goal is to provide a complete "asset-winding" preparation program that stores real-life (or digitally-owned) assets in a blockchain in some form.

To achieve this goal, the solution is provided as following:

**(1) Develop standardization of asset digitization characteristics (hash template)**: For three different types of assets, I extract the digitization features for different categories:
**a.	Distinguishability:** An asset representation method that can be uniquely identified and verifiable.
**b.	Compliance:** The process of standardizing asset characteristics should fully consider the legal status of assets, and actively adapt to regulatory and legal standards.
**c.	General purpose:** Structured (hierarchical) to develop standards, fully extract the same points of assets, so that sub-subclasses inherit the parent-parent class can be produced as much as possible

**(2) Develop standardized blockchain feature requirements:** A simple example is the ERC721 contract on Ethereum, which we can use to identify certain unique ones. At this protocol level, the task is to target the currently existing blockchain network, extracting its unified feature, in order to cover most blockchain types by the protocol layer. And for the development of the blockchain network, it is aimed to become the industry standard, so that it can actively adapt to our asset chain.

**(3) Formulate a sound supervision and fair guarantee mechanism:** Generally speaking, it is difficult to guarantee the "unforgeable" of physical assets through pure technical means. The solution is to adopt a protocol to establish a complete and effective monitoring mechanism.  The hash node that assumes:

**a.	Temporary storage of physical assets**
**b.	Digital feature extraction of physical assets**
**c.	Specific implementation of asset chaining**

The supervision mechanism is to make the above three points transparent. For example, the authenticity of physical assets in a, the compliance of asset extraction processes in b, and the uniqueness of assets in c (assets exist on a single chain at any time and up to at most). Introducing the verification of the human cluster: if the different blockchain projects are treated as members, the supervision actually operates in a community-based way. Therefore, we can establish a set of evaluation mechanisms (such as voting, random selection, etc.), introduce the verification of everyone into different interests, simplify the ledger content, establish an appropriate incentive program, and encourage nodes to carry out verification.

### 4.2 Technology level
#### 4.2.1 Introduction
The two key problems are **“asset-tokenization”** and **“asset cross-chain transfer”**.

**For the asset-tokenization**, at the protocol level, the digital standard of the asset and the corresponding blockchain requirements are devefinited with standard. At the technical level, a stable, highly efficient implementation of the solution to complete the actual operation of the asset chain will be given.

For the cross-chain transfer of assets, that is, the liquidity problem after the assets are tokenized, what we need to break through at the technical level is the cross-chain technology, so that the value can be directly circulated across the barriers.

Unlike the traditional exchange of digital currencies, TOC is concerned about a more ubiquitous value circulation. For example, after a realistic jersey is tokenized through the protocol layer (present in some form to chain a), we will transfer it to chain b.

This technical requirement is essentially two aspects:

1.	Guarantee the atomicity of the transaction, that is, a minus b plus as a whole operation.

2.	On the basis of effective implementation of the protocol layer, traceability is guaranteed.That is, the value in the chain b can be traced back to the chain a, ensuring the recognition of the value of the consensus (continuing the example of the jersey, that is, when the chain b is reached, it can still be equivalent to an identical jersey.)

#### 4.2.2 Implement roadmap
**(1) For the asset-winding problem**, it can be broke down into two sub-sub-problems:
a.	Digital feature extraction;
b.	Digital feature winding.

For a, different assets need different solutions.For blockchain native assets (digital currency) and digital assets, the extraction of digital features is easy; for physical (or physical-related) assets, usually speaking, only blockchain technology is impossible to solve the trust problem at the source. For example, we can ensure that the contents of the tokenized assets are not modified by the blockchain technology, but if one is forged at the same time as the backup, it can provide fake data and claim when used. This data is the real data of the chain at the time.

As shown in the protocol layer, the implementation of the supervisory mechanism is a chain of alliances. When the human worker is required to intervene, the data extractor extracts the digital characteristics of the physical assets strictly according to the protocol layer. When proving ownership (control), it is necessary to “underline” and “online” to confirm the record in the alliance chain as a guarantee of the authenticity of the data source afterwards, and the data disclosure is subject to supervision by community members. At the same time, it is a neeed to develop and provide IoT network technology to encrypt and format data on the hardware level.

For b, at the technical implementation level, it mainly focus on the following points: 

(1) **Load balancing**: According to the community and community load status described by the user, with the cross-chain, dynamic selection Optimal winding selection.

(2) **Self-automation deployment:** Compatible with various blockchain networks that meet the requirements of the protocol layer, and automatically compile and deploy the corresponding smart contracts.

There are many researches on asset cross-chain technology. The four mainstream cross-chain technologies are: Notary schemes, Sidechains/relays, Hash-locking, and Distributed private key control. They are mainly used for asset transfers, atomic sub-transactions (simultaneous exchange of inter-chain assets), cross-chain data prophecy (chain a needs to know the proof of the data of chain b), cross-chain execution of the line contract (for example according to the equity certificate of chain a, dividends are distributed on chain b) and cross-chain trading houses (for the protocol, the blockchain that supports the cross-chain operation is not directly supported).

This program is aimed to utilize two things:

1.	Assets are transferred across the chain;

2.	Decentralization.

From a technical point of view, this is actually two relatively independent things (analog than the accounting system, the centralization has solved the need for transfer, and the decentralization has solved the problem of trust).

Therefore, in the first step, this program creates a “centralized” hash relay station (again as a specific “hash node”), where it focus on the issue of asset cross-chain transfer (note that we are concerned here) the blockchain network that satisfies our tokenization demand at the protocol layer). For the user, it provides a simple and effective api, which satisfy two conditions in the introduction, so that the assets can be safely transferred.

This system is mainly composed of several modules:

a. **Accounting module**: Record the source of each transfer record in detail, so that it can be traceable.

b. **Atomic sub-transaction easy-to-protect module**: Take a hash time lock (or a more powerful and powerful smart contract).

c. **Self-compilation deployment module:** This module needs to open the data storage escaping function between different chains, and the data content will be on the chain A.
Self-compiled and deployed into chain b is the actual execution line module.

In the second step, it will “decentralize” the hash relay station. For the balance of efficiency and safety, the transit station will adopt the public chain with DPOS mechanism.

### 4.3 Application level
#### 4.3.1 Introduction
The goal of application level is to provide users with safe and easy-to-use asset-winding and transfer tools for users, and to provide developers with internalization protocol layer and technology layer blockchain technology. 

#### 4.3.2 Implementation route

**TOC World Ecosystem**

The TOC World will use the mobile end as the entry point to educate grand hands with  high-quality blockchain projects through a gamified way. Specifically, it can be divided into the following three core modules: hash window, hash asset, hash wallet.

 - **Hash window: new traffic volume into the entrance**

Hash Window adopts a new type of streaming media technology combining human artificial intelligence and blockchain to promote popular blockchain technology and high-quality tokens to users. The streaming media format includes playing games, doing tasks, watching news, etc., and users get the tokens while understanding the purpose of the high-quality token project. The essence of the hash window is to use the user's attention to cash in. Hash Window's human artificial intelligence technology will automatically learn the user's cognitive level and interest distribution from the automatic learning, and truly achieve accurate delivery and real-time feedback, and build a bridge between the project and the user. The Hash Window will be the first portal for users to understand and understand the blockchain.
Hash Windows also provides high-quality publicity channels and precise touch-up support for a wide range of large-end customers, helping high-quality content providers and content consumers to establish an organic relationship, dynamically matching to meet the needs of different c-end uses the customization requirements of the user and the different b-end users.Really become the center of attention
Power content distribution platform.

 - **Hash assets: ERC 721 trading platform**

The digitization of assets is one of the greatest applications of blockchain technology. Hash Assets will use the form of virtual real estate auctions to let grand hand users use the cognitive chain block to identify the content of digital assets. Value, the future Hash assets will be the core of the core of the "asset on the chain" digital asset securitization technology.

 - **TOC Wallet: Token wallet with consumer scenes**

Token is the most direct and strong form of the user who becomes a member of the blockchain community. The TOC wallet provides users with a mobile center-centric token hosting service for new users.

Similar to the "balance" in the field of digital currency. TOC Wallet will also expand the application scenarios including the token exchange, the token fund, the gold and the small amount of payment, and so on. Compared with other wallets, the TOC wallet has a huge development space by using hash windows and hash assets to form high frequency and long stickiness for users.

TOC Wallet is aimed to help new users to establish their understanding of digital currency and digital assets. At the same time, it will expand the application scenarios, and let new users realize the charm and fun of the blockchain, so that everyone can enjoy the dividends of blockchain technology development.
